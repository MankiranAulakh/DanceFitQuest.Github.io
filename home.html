           <p>We express our feelings and emotions through various sources, like speech, song, painting, etc. Dance is one such source. Even a little child use dance to express his/her happiness.
            Dance is an art. It spreads happiness and joy, and in country like India where we have so many cultures and festivals, it forms an important part. Every culture has its own dance form and festivals are incomplete without it.</p>
           <p> Dance is one of the common hobbies of children. Children enjoy dancing. Even adults and old age people love it. Many countries give a lot of importance to dance. When we talk about choosing dance as a career, it is a great option. But you need to have love and passion for it. Every career option needs hardwork, passion, practice and determination for success, dance also needs the same. If you have these qualities, go for it. No obstacle can stop you from being successful.</p>
